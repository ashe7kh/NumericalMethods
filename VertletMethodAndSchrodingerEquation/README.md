A program that calculates the eigenenergies, and thusly the eigenfunctions of the Schrodinger equation for a double potential well (4th degree polynomial with two "buckets"), using the verlet algorithm to calculate the eigenfunctions

Contains several plots for variations on the parameter lambda, which change the potential well to make the centre "hump" larger or smaller, the change in the associated eigenfunctions and eigen energies can be seen in the code files as well as the plots

Does a good job of illustrating the intuition of the schrodinger equation how the potential affects the associated eigenfunctions, as well as giving a dip into PDE's in general.
